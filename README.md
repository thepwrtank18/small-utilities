# Small Utilities
A bunch of small utilities I made.
## Utilities
### Clear Icon Cache
Tired of your icons being blank paper? Here is your solution! Just run as admin, and you're good!

### Reset Connection
If you keep having to restart your computer because of "No internet, secured", you can fix that here. *Do not run this as admin unless you need to.*

### More
More is coming soonâ„¢.

## Releases
The releases are in "packs". Here is an example:


Program 1 v1 is released. This goes in Pack 1.

Program 1 v2 and Program 2 v1 is released. This goes in Pack 2.

Program 1 v3 and Program 2 v2 is released. This goes in Pack 3.

Basically, all items in the same release date (or a day or 2 after) are in "packs".
